[‰∏≠Êñá](README.md)

A faithful recreation of the [Farmer's Delight mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight) implemented using PaperAPI + NeoArtisan framework and client-side resource packs, delivering full mod functionality through server-side technology.

> üü® This project requires [NeoArtisan](https://github.com/KitsunaiMC/NeoArtisan) as a dependency plugin

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Pure Server-Side Implementation**: Only requires client resource packs + Paper server plugin
- **Protocol-Level Magic**: Uses data packs and chunk manipulation to trick clients into rendering custom blocks
- **Perfect Compatibility**: Block behavior layer built on PaperAPI without NMS dependencies
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend
